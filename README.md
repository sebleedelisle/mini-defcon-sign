You'll need to install the Adafruit DotStar library.

NOTES

* If you're using the newer style 5V Trinket with the micro USB connector, then use the STL marked NEW_TRINKET
* Not all LED strips are wired the same. Check the 5V and ground pins connect to the appropriate inputs on the LED. Pin 0 on the Trinket goes to the Clock input (sometimes marked CLK, SC, CI etc), Trinket Pin 1 goes to the data input (SDI, DI etc).
